# Azure Service Bus Plugin

Welcome to the **Azure Service Bus** plugin! This plugin integrates Azure Service Bus functionalities into Backstage.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository. You can access it by running:

```bash
yarn start
```

Then navigate to: [http://localhost:3000/azure-service-bus](http://localhost:3000/azure-service-bus).

For faster iteration during development, you can serve the plugin in isolation:

```bash
cd plugins/azure-service-bus
yarn start
```

> **Note:** This method is only for local development. The setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.

Ensure the `pipelineUrl` is correctly set in your `app-config.yaml`.
